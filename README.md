# Links to useful resources for devs


Developers usually have their own stash of resources from which they learn or use in their work. I have acquired good links to resources online and offline over the years that might benefit devs of all ages. I am going to be sharing them here and any passer-by can contribute to this just by forking **this** file to help others.
